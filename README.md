# Ad Management — Flarum Extension

> **Note:** This is a fork of [wyatts97/flarum-ext-ad-management](https://github.com/wyatts97/flarum-ext-ad-management) updated for Flarum 2.0 compatibility.

A comprehensive ad management system for [Flarum](https://flarum.org) forums. Supports image banners, HTML/JS ads, and Google AdSense with zones, analytics, an approval workflow, and a user self-service portal.

## Features

- **Ad Zones** — Named positions (`header`, `below_header`, `between_posts`, `sidebar`, `above_footer`, `footer`, `custom`) with optional dimension constraints
- **Ad Types** — Image banners, raw HTML/JS, and Google AdSense units
- **Rotation** — One random ad per zone per page load (randomized each visit)
- **Analytics** — Per-ad impression and click tracking with daily breakdowns and CTR
- **Approval Workflow** — User-submitted ads queue for admin review before going live; optional approval for image changes
- **Email Notifications** — Expiration reminders and performance reports via cron, with customizable templates
- **Admin Notifications** — Instant email alert when a user submits an ad for review
- **Rate Limiting** — Anti-fraud protection on click and impression tracking endpoints
- **Group Visibility** — Show ads only to specific member groups; hide ads for premium groups
- **Post Shortcodes** — Embed any zone inline in discussion posts: `{myadvertisements[zone_name]}`
- **Image Processing** — Automatic resizing to zone dimensions; optional compression via PHP GD or reSmush.it API
- **GDPR Compliance** — Purge old click records with the built-in console command

## Requirements

- Flarum `^2.0.0-rc.1`
- PHP `^8.3` with GD extension (for image resizing/compression)
- PHP `curl` extension (optional, for reSmush.it API compression)
